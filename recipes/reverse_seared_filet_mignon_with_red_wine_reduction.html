    <h2>Reverse Seared Filet Mignon With Red Wine Reduction:</h2>
    <h1>Ingredients:</h1>

    <h3>Main:</h3>
    <p>2 Filet Mignon Steaks<br></p>
    <p>To Taste Prime Rib Rub<br></p>
    <p>2 Slices Bacon<br></p>

    <h3>Red Wine Reduction:</h3>
    <p>2 Tablespoon Unsalted butter, cold, cubed<br></p>
    <p>1 shallot, thinly sliced<br></p>
    <p>1/2 Cup red wine<br></p>
    <p>1/2 Cup beef stock<br></p>
    <p>1 Teaspoon chopped fresh rosemary<br></p>
    <p>To Taste kosher salt<br></p>

    <h1>Instructions:</h1>
    <p>1. When ready to cook, set the Traeger temperature to 225℉ and preheat with the lid closed for 15 minutes. For
        optimal flavor, use Super Smoke, if available.<br></p>
    <p>2. Wrap a slice of bacon around each filet and secure with a toothpick. Season liberally with Traeger Prime Rib
        Rub.<br></p>
    <p>3. Insert the probe into the center of a filet. Place the steaks directly on the grill grates. Close the lid and
        cook until the internal temperature reaches 115℉, about 20 minutes.<br></p>
    <p>4. Remove the steaks from the grill. Increase the grill temperature to 450°F (or 500℉, if available), close the
        lid, and preheat 10 minutes.<br></p>
    <p>5. Meanwhile, make the red wine reduction: Melt 1 tablespoon of butter in a medium pan over medium heat. Add the
        shallots and sauté until translucent. Add the red wine and beef stock and bring to a simmer. Reduce the heat to
        low and simmer until the liquid has reduced by half. Stir in the rosemary, then remove the pan from the heat.
        Whisk in the remaining tablespoon of butter. Season with salt to taste.<br></p>
    <p>6. Return the steaks to the grill and re-insert the probe. Sear until the internal temperature reaches 125°F for
        medium-rare or your desired temperature, 5–7 minutes per side.<br></p>
    <p>7. Remove the steaks from the grill and let rest for 5–7 minutes.<br></p>
    <p>8. Serve the steaks with your favorite sides and spoon the red wine reduction sauce over the top. Enjoy!<br></p>
